A Movie review platform build by using MERN stack. with strong authentication, where users can login and share their experience about the movie. 

How it works
  --> When user visit the website first time user needs to create an account with the email
  --> login with the credentials they are given at the time of registeration.
  --> In the landing page user sees different movies where user can click on the poster and share their response in that page.
  --> and user able to see the others revies to know before going to that movie

--> this website movies data are made by the custom apis, from the backend. in future we will add the featured section. where users can see the upcomming movie details. 
    after release of that movie the movie is added in the landing page from there users can share experience.
